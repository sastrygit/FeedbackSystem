<center><h3>ONLINE FEEDBACK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT</h3></center>

<p>In order to maintain a good recognition at college, the management does every possible aspect in maintaining the qualities of the lecturer’s. As this is the online-era, where everything is online we need to develop a system in online which is very useful to maintain feedback reports by the administrator.
The purpose of this project is to make the process of taking feedback from the students in online regarding the lecturer’s teaching. With this, the institutes can access the feedback reports in a faster way and without any loss of data. As of now this task was done manually with the use of papers and pens. This has many drawbacks and evaluating this hand written forms is a difficult process.
Student needs to logging into the website of online feedback system and giving his/her feedback and can perform modifications too. But the restriction here is once the student submits the report then he cannot modify it later. With this the student can successfully submit feedback on lecturer’s teaching in a very efficient manner without any loss of data. The administrator and the faculty members can access these feedbacks from the students and take appropriate actions.

<br><h3>Conclusion:<br>
This online feedback system is used by the students to submit the feedback online and which can be accessed by the faculty as well as administrator
</p>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<p>
Online feedback management system is the web based feedback collecting system from the students and provides the automatic generation of a feedback which is given by students. We have developed student feedback system to provide feedback in a quick and easy manner to the particular department. So we called it a student’s feedback system which delivers via the student staff interface as online system which acting as a service provider. By using this technology we can give feedback in online system as fast as compare to the existing paper feedback system.
The existing system carries more time to do a piece of work for this reason the online system feedback is implemented. Students will fill online feedback using a standard form. In this project security is also maintain that is the result of feedback is only visible to authentic user.

<h3>1. INTRODUCTION - STUDENT STAFF FEEDBACK SYSTEM PROJECT</h3><br/>
<p>The Online Feedback System is a management information system for education establishments to manage student data. Online Feedback Systems provide capabilities for selecting particular subject for feedback and generate the report automatically, build student details, student-related data needs in a college. A Online Feedback System is an automatic feedback generation system that provides the proper feedback to the teachers as per the categories like always, poor, usually, very often, sometimes. In the existing system students can give feedback about the lecturers by doing manually. By this process student can give feedback in online system without wasting his time in writing. After giving feedback by every student papers are collected by the faculty and calculated the overall grade for each subject and each lecturer. After that those all grade report is viewed by the HOD which is given by the faculty. Hence estimating the performance of lecturers and giving feedback to college staff. So, the existing system carries more time to do a piece of work for this reason the online system feedback is implemented. This is the main disadvantage of the existing system for giving feedback about the lecturers and viewing report of lecturers manually. Student feedback on courses is an essential element in quality assurance. Questionnaires are of primary importance in the dialogue with students, since they are the best tool we currently have for collecting objective, detailed and reasonably systematic information on a wide range of questions, which Informs the teacher about student’s perceptions of the course's strengths and weaknesses. Responses are collated on behalf of departments by the system, and will be used only for the purposes of quality enhancement. The aim of this is to save time for staff in academic departments and to allow a minimum level of statistical analysis of the data across the College. This recognizes that whilst the information remains the property of the College.

<h3><br>In order to gain maximum advantage:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Students should be told how the feedback will be submitted, when and how the results will be published, and that their contribution is important and taken seriously.

The Head of Department should discuss a dispassionate summary of the feedback on each course with the
lecturers concerned;
<li> An analysis of questionnaire returns which concern the department as a whole should be published within
the department, and referred to as appropriate in the Annual Review report.
</ul>
<h3>
2. OBJECTIVES</h3>
<ol>
<li> Decision making power is provided by this system.
<li> Accurate result can be obtained.
<li> This system makes Selection process more effective
<li> To increase efficiency proposed system is depend on classification method.
<li> Proposed system is used to reduce confusion at the time of processing feedback average.
